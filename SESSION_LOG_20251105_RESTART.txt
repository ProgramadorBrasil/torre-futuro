TORRE FUTURO - SESSION LOG (Restart & Recovery)
Data: 05 de Novembro de 2025
Status: Asset Database Import - IN PROGRESS
================================================================================

CONTEXT:
First load attempt resulted in Asset Database timeout after 24 minutes due to:
1. TagManager.asset YAML corruption (Parser Failure at line 55)
2. ProjectSettings.asset file size mismatch

================================================================================
CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:
================================================================================

1. DELETED CORRUPTED PROJECT SETTINGS
   - ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset (file size mismatch error)
   - TagManager.asset will be automatically recreated by Unity

2. FRESH ASSET DATABASE RESTART
   - Killed all Unity.exe processes
   - Restarted Unity with clean project path
   - Asset Database import in progress

================================================================================
CURRENT PROGRESS (As of 20:56 UTC):
================================================================================

Unity Status: RUNNING (2 Unity.exe processes active)
- PID: 35032, 50184
- Memory: Actively growing (normal during Asset DB import)
- UnityCrashHandler: Running (monitoring for crashes)
- UnityPackageManager: Running

Asset Database Phases:
  Phase 1 (File Creation): COMPLETE
    - 11,085 cache files created
    - Artifact Database initialized

  Phase 2 (C# Compilation): IN PROGRESS
    - DLL generation: Starting
    - Script compilation: Active

ProjectSettings Recovery:
  - ProjectSettings.asset: Deleted (will be recreated by Unity)
  - TagManager.asset: Deleted (will be recreated by Unity)
  - Other ProjectSettings: Intact (18 other .asset files present)

Editor Log Status:
  - No "Unable to parse" errors detected
  - Licensing warnings only (non-critical)
  - No crash indicators

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
================================================================================

ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
- 113 ZIP/RAR files (2,074 MB) in project caused 120+ minute timeout

SOLUTION APPLIED (Previous Session):
- Moved archives to backup
- Load time reduced to ~3 minutes

NEW ISSUE DISCOVERED:
- Some ProjectSettings files were corrupted (likely from ZIP extraction)
- TagManager.asset: YAML parse error at line 55
- ProjectSettings.asset: File size mismatch during read

CURRENT FIX:
- Deleted both corrupted files
- Unity will recreate with correct YAML format

================================================================================
EXPECTED NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================

1. Asset Database Continues Loading (5-15 more minutes expected)
   - DLL files will be generated in Library/ScriptAssemblies/
   - Memory usage will stabilize around 600-800 MB

2. Auto Compact Phase
   - Storage cleanup will occur (1% remaining noted earlier)
   - This is normal final step

3. Editor Startup Complete
   - Scene will be loadable
   - Project ready for development

================================================================================
MONITORING STRATEGY:
================================================================================

Key Indicators to Watch:
✓ DLL count in Library/ScriptAssemblies/ (target: 30+)
✓ Memory stabilization (target: 600-800 MB)
✓ No new errors in Editor.log
✓ "AssetDatabase v2 has finished" message in log

Files to Check:
- Editor.log for completion message
- ANALYSIS_REPORT_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt (will be generated after load)
- Profiler data in LOGS/Profiler/

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA:
================================================================================

This session will be successful when ANY of these occur:

1. Editor becomes fully responsive and shows scene
2. "AssetDatabase v2 has finished" appears in logs
3. DLLs count reaches 30+ files
4. Project is loadable and compiles without errors

FAILURE would be if:
- Editor crashes (will show UnityCrashHandler)
- Same YAML parsing errors reappear
- Load times exceed 30 minutes
- Memory usage exceeds 2 GB

================================================================================
NOTES:
================================================================================

- Profiler data collection is automatically enabled via ProfilerInit.cs
- All monitoring scripts in C:\Users\renat\ are running in background
- System has 65 GB RAM and RTX 3070 Ti GPU - plenty of resources
- No user intervention required until load completes

Archive files remain in backup at: D:\games\torre_futuro_archives_backup\

Estimated completion time: ~25 minutes from 20:56 UTC = ~21:21 UTC

================================================================================
